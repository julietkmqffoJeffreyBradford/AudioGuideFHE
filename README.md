# AudioGuideFHE

**AudioGuideFHE** is a privacy-preserving personalized museum audio guide system that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to generate real-time, individualized audio recommendations based on encrypted visitor behavior. The platform allows museums to enhance visitor experience while maintaining strict privacy protections.

## Project Background

Personalized museum experiences can greatly improve visitor engagement, yet traditional personalization approaches face several privacy challenges:

- **Visitor Privacy:** Tracking routes, dwell times, and exhibit interactions can reveal sensitive behavioral patterns.  
- **Data Misuse Risk:** Storing unencrypted personal activity data can lead to breaches or unauthorized profiling.  
- **Limited Personalization:** Without secure computation, personalization must compromise privacy or be generic.  
- **Real-Time Adaptation:** Dynamic guidance requires processing sensitive data instantly without exposure.

**AudioGuideFHE addresses these issues** by allowing encrypted visitor behavior data to be analyzed securely, enabling personalized audio content recommendations without revealing sensitive information.

## Core Features

### Personalized Audio Recommendations

- **Encrypted Visitor Data:** User location, dwell times, and route choices are fully encrypted on-device.  
- **FHE Computation:** Algorithms generate personalized guidance and content dynamically without decrypting sensitive inputs.  
- **Contextual Insights:** Recommendations adapt to visitor progress, interests, and engagement patterns.  
- **Multi-Language Support:** Audio output can be customized per visitor preferences without revealing language choices.

### Privacy & Confidentiality

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Visitor behavior data remains encrypted throughout collection, transmission, and processing.  
- **Client-Side Security:** Data is encrypted locally before leaving the device.  
- **Anonymous Profiles:** No personally identifiable information is required.  
- **Data Minimization:** Only encrypted behavioral patterns are stored or analyzed, minimizing privacy risk.

### Visitor Experience Enhancements

- **Dynamic Navigation:** Audio guidance adapts to real-time movement and interests.  
- **Exhibit Recommendations:** Visitors receive suggestions for related exhibits or artifacts.  
- **Interactive Storytelling:** Personalized narratives enhance engagement with art or historical content.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics:** Museums gain insights into visitor behavior trends without accessing raw data.
